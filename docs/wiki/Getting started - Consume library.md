In case you want to simply consume the modules of the library to build a solution, you only have to perform a few simple steps:

1. [Download a release / clone repository](#1-download-a-release--clone-repository)
1. [(Optional) Convert library to ARM](#2-optional-convert-library-to-arm)
1. [Build solution](#3-build-solution)

# 1. Download a release / clone repository

To gather a local copy of the library, you essentially have two options to choose from:

<details>
<summary>Download a release</summary>

TODO: Fill

</details>

<details>
<summary>Clone repository</summary>

TODO: Fill

</details>

# 2. (Optional) Convert library to ARM

Note that in case you don't want to use Bicep, you always have the option to use the utility `ConvertTo-ARMTemplate`, we provide in path `utilities/tools`, to convert the repository to an ARM-only repository. For further information on how to use the tool, please refer to the tool-specific [documentation](./Getting%20started%20-%20ConvertTo-ARMTemplate).

# 3. Build solution

TODO: Fill. Add example for local template (or reference Module Usage / completely new section?)
